  <h1>INFRABEL — Operational Points</h1>
  <pre><code>GET /infrabel/operational-points</code></pre>
  <p class="muted">
    Returns operational points (stations, junctions, borders, yards) on Belgium's railway network with detailed nomenclature and geographic coordinates.
  </p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This endpoint provides comprehensive data on operational points—discrete locations on Belgium's rail network where significant operational activities occur.
      Operational points include passenger stations (where trains stop for boarding/alighting), freight terminals (cargo loading/unloading), junctions (where lines converge/diverge), border crossings (international connections), and marshaling yards (freight train assembly).
      Each point is identified by multiple naming conventions (short/long names in Dutch and French reflecting Belgium's bilingualism), classified by operational importance (major hubs vs. minor stops), and precisely geolocated.
      This dataset forms the node layer for network topology analysis when combined with Line Sections (edges), enabling graph-based routing algorithms, network connectivity studies, and service accessibility analysis.
      Essential for passenger information systems (station lookup), infrastructure planning (understanding network structure), and operational coordination (referencing locations in train scheduling and traffic management).

    <h2>Output Data Attributes</h2>
    <p>The response is a GeoJSON <code>FeatureCollection</code> representing operational points across Belgium's rail network.</p>
    <table>
      <tr><th>Attribute</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr>
      <tr><td>type</td><td>string</td><td>Always <code>FeatureCollection</code>. Standard GeoJSON container format ensuring compatibility with GIS platforms (QGIS, ArcGIS, PostGIS), web mapping libraries (Leaflet, Mapbox GL JS, OpenLayers), and spatial analysis tools. Collection represents complete set of operational points for the queried timestamp, forming the node layer of Belgium's rail network graph when paired with Line Sections (edge layer). Enables topological analysis (connectivity, centrality metrics), visualization (station maps with popup details), and integration with train service data (mapping train positions/schedules to network locations).</td></tr>
      <tr><td>features</td><td>array</td><td>Array of operational point features, each representing a discrete location on Belgium's rail network. Typical size: 800-1200 operational points covering passenger stations (500-700), freight facilities (100-200), junctions/crossovers (100-300), border points (10-20), and specialized locations (maintenance depots, control posts). Array includes all operational point types classified by <code>classification</code> field: major stations (Brussels Central, Antwerp Central, Liège-Guillemins serving 10,000s daily passengers), minor stops (small village stations with few daily trains), technical points (unmanned junctions, border crossings used only for traffic management), and inactive locations (closed stations retained for historical reference). Feature count evolves over time: new stations added (network expansion, reopened lines), closures (low-ridership stops, line abandonment), renaming (municipality name changes, modernization projects). Used for: (1) Station lookup services (find station by name for journey planning), (2) Network topology construction (nodes for graph algorithms), (3) Service coverage analysis (population within X km of stations), (4) Accessibility mapping (stations with disabled access), (5) International coordination (border point identification for cross-border services). Each feature includes multiple name variants (short/long, Dutch/French) accommodating Belgium's complex linguistic landscape and multiple operational nomenclatures (passenger-facing names, internal codes, timetable abbreviations).</td></tr>
      <tr><td>features[].type</td><td>string</td><td>Always <code>Feature</code>. Standard GeoJSON object type for individual spatial entities. Each feature represents one operational point with its geographic location (geometry) and descriptive attributes (properties). Consistent typing enables standard geospatial processing workflows: feature filtering, attribute queries, spatial joins with other datasets (population, land use), and uniform visualization (markers, labels, popups). Essential for maintaining GeoJSON specification compliance and interoperability across diverse tools and platforms.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>features[].geometry</td><td>object</td><td>GeoJSON Point geometry containing operational point's geographic coordinates. Represents physical location of station entrance, junction center, or administratively-defined point for non-physical locations (border markers, abstract control zones). Precision typically 5-6 decimal places (~1-10 meter accuracy), sufficient for mapping and analysis though not surveyed to centimeter precision. Enables spatial operations: distance calculations (proximity analysis, catchment areas), map rendering (station markers, labels), spatial queries (points within bounding box), and integration with other geographic datasets (population density, transit access analysis). Coordinates critical for passenger wayfinding (mapping station locations in journey planners), service area analysis (defining X-km radius around stations for accessibility studies), and network visualization (plotting network graph with geographically accurate node positions).</td></tr>
      <tr><td>geometry.type</td><td>string</td><td>Always <code>Point</code>. GeoJSON geometry type for zero-dimensional locations. Points represent discrete positions rather than linear features (LineString for tracks) or areal features (Polygon for station precincts). Point geometry simplifies distance calculations (point-to-point haversine formula), proximity queries (nearest station to location X), and marker-based mapping (stations as icons/pins on maps). Standard for representing locations in transit networks where operational activities occur at specific coordinates rather than along extended areas.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>geometry.coordinates</td><td>array</td><td>Two-element numeric array <code>[longitude, latitude]</code> specifying operational point position in WGS84 (EPSG:4326) decimal degrees. Belgium coordinate ranges: longitude 2.5-6.4°E, latitude 49.5-51.5°N. Order follows GeoJSON/WGS84 convention (longitude first, latitude second)—note this differs from some systems expecting [lat, lon] order, a common integration pitfall. Precision typically 5-7 decimal places, providing ~1-10 meter accuracy adequate for station-level positioning. Used directly by mapping libraries for marker placement, routing engines for waypoint coordinates, and distance calculators for proximity analysis. Example: <code>[4.3517, 50.8466]</code> for Brussels Central Station (50.8466°N, 4.3517°E).</td></tr>
      <tr><td>properties.ptcarid</td><td>string</td><td>Primary operational point identifier in Infrabel's systems. Alphanumeric code (often 4-8 characters) uniquely identifying each location in traffic management, timetabling, and infrastructure databases. Format examples: "BE.BNAMZ" (Brussels North/Amsterdam), "BXLCE" (Brussels Central), "LGG" (Liège-Guillemins). Code structure may encode: country prefix (BE for Belgium), location abbreviation (3-5 letters), or hierarchical subdivisions. Stable identifier persisting across name changes, renovations, and operational updates—critical for historical data integrity and cross-system integration. Used extensively in operational contexts: (1) Train scheduling (timetables reference ptcarid for timing points), (2) Traffic management (dispatchers coordinate train movements by ptcarid), (3) Punctuality reporting (delays attributed to specific ptcarid locations), (4) Infrastructure planning (investment projects target ptcarid-identified stations). Also serves as foreign key linking to other datasets: Line Sections (sections connect ptcarid endpoints), punctuality reports (delays by ptcarid), real-time train positions (trains approaching/departing ptcarid). Essential for data integration across Infrabel and operator (SNCB/NMBS) systems.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>properties.taftapcode</td><td>string</td><td>TAF/TAP code—standardized European railway location code from Technical Specifications for Interoperability (TSI). Format typically "BE" (country) + 5-character location code (e.g., "BEBMI" for Brussels Midi/South). Part of Trans-European rail data exchange framework enabling cross-border train operations: (1) International timetable coordination (trains crossing multiple countries reference consistent location codes), (2) Passenger information systems (showing international connections using standardized codes), (3) Freight documentation (cargo routing through multiple networks). TAF/TAP codes standardize location identification across 30+ European countries, essential for EU's integrated rail network vision. Not all operational points have TAF/TAP codes—primarily major stations with international service, border points, and freight terminals. May be empty/null for minor domestic-only locations. Used by international train operators (Eurostar, Thalys, international freight) and multi-national journey planners requiring consistent location references.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>properties.symbolicname</td><td>string</td><td>Internal symbolic identifier used in Infrabel's operational systems, particularly traffic management and signaling databases. Often cryptic alphanumeric code (e.g., "BXL_CTR", "ANR_JCT") following internal naming conventions. Unlike public-facing names (longnamedutch/french), symbolic names are system-oriented, stable across language changes, and designed for machine processing rather than human readability. Used in: (1) Signaling systems (referencing control points in interlocking logic), (2) Traffic management software (location identifiers in routing algorithms), (3) Maintenance databases (linking work orders to infrastructure locations), (4) Technical documentation (engineering specifications). Not typically shown to passengers but critical for operational staff (dispatchers, signal engineers, maintenance crews). Provides unambiguous technical reference when multiple names exist (official names change with municipality renaming, symbolic names remain stable).</td></tr>
      <tr><td>properties.classification</td><td>string</td><td>Operational point classification indicating type and importance. Standard values: <strong>"Passenger Station"</strong> (public passenger service—from major hubs to small village stops), <strong>"Junction"</strong> (line convergence/divergence points, often unmanned), <strong>"Freight Terminal"</strong> (cargo handling facilities), <strong>"Border Point"</strong> (international boundary crossings), <strong>"Depot"</strong> (maintenance facilities, train storage), <strong>"Shunting Yard"</strong> (freight marshaling). Classification drives: (1) Service planning (passenger stations require amenities, information displays), (2) Capacity analysis (junctions are bottlenecks, stations have platform capacity), (3) Investment prioritization (passenger station upgrades vs. freight terminal automation), (4) Accessibility analysis (only passenger stations relevant for public transport studies). Classification combined with other attributes (class_en/fr below) provides hierarchical importance: major passenger hubs (intercity connections, high traffic) vs. regional stops (local service only) vs. request stops (trains stop only when flagged). Essential for filtering: "show only passenger stations for journey planning", "identify junction bottlenecks", "map freight terminals for logistics planning".</td></tr>
      <tr><td>properties.class_en</td><td>string</td><td>Classification in English, typically echoing or translating <code>classification</code> field. Values: "Passenger Station", "Junction", "Freight Terminal", "Border Crossing", "Depot", "Yard". Provided for English-language applications, reports, and international users. Some records may refine classification with importance indicators: "Major Station" (10,000+ daily passengers, intercity connections), "Minor Station" (local service only), "Request Stop" (trains stop on demand). Used in user-facing applications (journey planners showing station types), analytical reports (categorizing network by point type), and data exports for international stakeholders preferring English terminology. When combined with class_fr, enables bilingual applications serving Belgium's diverse linguistic communities.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>properties.class_fr</td><td>string</td><td>Classification in French—"Gare" (station), "Jonction" (junction), "Terminal marchandises" (freight terminal), "Point frontalier" (border point), "Dépôt" (depot). Parallel to class_en for French-speaking users (Wallonia, Brussels French community, international French speakers). Belgium's official bilingualism (French/Dutch) requires maintaining parallel nomenclatures for public transparency and legal compliance. Used in French-language passenger information (SNCB/NMBS website French version, announcements in French-speaking regions), regulatory reporting to French-speaking authorities, and bilingual mapping applications showing names in user's preferred language. Essential for serving Belgium's diverse population: Wallonia (French-speaking south, 30%+ population), Brussels (officially bilingual, majority French-speaking), international visitors (French widely spoken in Europe).</td></tr>
      <tr><td>properties.shortnamedutch</td><td>string</td><td>Short station name in Dutch, typically abbreviated form suitable for timetables, platform displays, and space-constrained interfaces. Examples: "Brussel-Z." (Brussels South), "Antw.-C." (Antwerp Central), "Gent-S.P." (Gent-Sint-Pieters). Abbreviations vary: truncated words, acronyms, omitted articles. Used in: (1) Printed timetables (limited column width), (2) Platform displays (LED screens with character limits), (3) Mobile apps (compact lists), (4) Operational communications (radio traffic). Balance between brevity and recognizability—abbreviations should be intuitive to local users. Reflects Flemish (Dutch-speaking) community's language (northern Belgium, 60%+ population). Essential for applications serving Flemish travelers, printed schedules distributed in Flanders, and bilingual displays where space is limited (showing both Dutch and French short names).</td></tr>
      <tr><td>properties.shortnamefrench</td><td>string</td><td>Short station name in French, paralleling shortnamedutch. Examples: "Brux.-Midi" (Brussels South), "Anvers-C." (Antwerp Central), "Gand-S.P." (Ghent-Sint-Pieters). Used in French-language contexts: timetables for Wallonia, announcements on French-speaking platforms, mobile apps set to French language. Maintains consistency with shortnamedutch (same abbreviation logic) while respecting French naming conventions (different word order, articles, spelling). Critical for Belgium's bilingual passenger service—SNCB/NMBS legally required to provide information in both national languages. Used in journey planners (showing short names in user's selected language), departure boards (space-efficient display), and operational systems (concise location references in French-language communications).</td></tr>
      <tr><td>properties.longnamedutch</td><td>string</td><td>Full official station name in Dutch, unabbreviated form used in formal communications, legal documents, and official signage. Examples: "Brussel-Zuid" (Brussels South), "Antwerpen-Centraal" (Antwerp Central), "Gent-Sint-Pieters" (Ghent-Sint-Pieters). Reflects official Dutch nomenclature following Belgian/Flemish linguistic standards: hyphenated city-station format for disambiguation, preservation of historical names (Sint-Pieters), standardized spelling. Used in: (1) Official timetables (formal printed schedules), (2) Website/app detailed views (full name for clarity), (3) Legal documents (contracts, regulations), (4) Historical records (consistent official naming). Long names ensure unambiguous identification when multiple stations serve same city (Brussels has 6 major stations, each with distinct long name). Essential for regulatory compliance (official language requirements), data integration (matching stations across datasets using authoritative names), and passenger clarity (avoiding abbreviation confusion).</td></tr>
      <tr><td>properties.longnamefrench</td><td>string</td><td>Full official station name in French, parallel to longnamedutch. Examples: "Bruxelles-Midi" (Brussels South), "Anvers-Central" (Antwerp Central), "Gand-Saint-Pierre" (Ghent-Sint-Pieters). Follows French naming conventions: different translation of city names (Bruxelles vs. Brussel), French forms of saint names (Saint-Pierre vs. Sint-Pieters), hyphenation patterns. Used in French-language formal contexts: official timetables for French speakers, legal documentation in French, formal announcements and signage in French-speaking regions. Belgium's bilingualism necessitates maintaining parallel official names—both languages have equal legal status. Critical for serving French-speaking population (Wallonia, Brussels), international French speakers (France, Luxembourg, Switzerland connections), and ensuring regulatory compliance. Used in journey planning (unambiguous station identification), data exchange (matching stations with international French-language systems), and historical research (tracking station name evolution in official French nomenclature).</td></tr>
      <tr><td>properties.commercialshortnamedu</td><td>string</td><td>Commercial short name in Dutch—marketing-oriented abbreviated form used in customer-facing materials. May differ from operational shortnamedutch to improve brand recognition, simplify pronunciation, or align with local colloquial usage. Examples might simplify historical names, modernize spelling, or emphasize landmark associations ("Brussel Airport" vs. technical "Brussel-Nationaal-Luchthaven"). Used in: (1) Marketing materials (posters, campaigns), (2) Customer-facing apps (friendly names), (3) Tourist information (recognizable names for international visitors). Balances official nomenclature (regulatory compliance) with user friendliness (easy to understand, memorable). May be identical to shortnamedutch for many stations or provide alternative branding for strategic locations.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>properties.commercialshortnamefrench</td><td>string</td><td>Commercial short name in French, paralleling commercial Dutch name. Provides marketing-friendly abbreviated French names for passenger-facing materials. Used in French-language marketing, tourist guides, and customer apps. Ensures bilingual branding consistency while accommodating French naming conventions. May simplify complex official names for better customer comprehension.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>properties.commercialmiddlenamedutch</td><td>string</td><td>Medium-length commercial name in Dutch—intermediate form between short (highly abbreviated) and long (full official). Balances brevity with clarity, suitable for: (1) Station announcement voiceovers (clear pronunciation without excessive length), (2) Medium-sized displays (electronic boards, app list views), (3) Journey planner results (readable without abbreviation confusion). Provides flexibility for different interface constraints—use short for tightest spaces, middle for moderate constraints, long for detail views. Used in SNCB/NMBS customer touchpoints balancing space and clarity.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>properties.commercialmiddlenamefrench</td><td>string</td><td>Medium-length commercial name in French, parallel to Dutch middle name. Serves same purposes: announcements, medium-sized displays, journey planners. Maintains French naming conventions at intermediate length. Used in French-language customer interfaces requiring balance between brevity and full clarity.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>properties.commerciallongnamedutch</td><td>string</td><td>Full commercial name in Dutch—comprehensive passenger-friendly form used in detailed displays, websites, and formal customer communications. May match or slightly differ from official longnamedutch, emphasizing customer understanding over bureaucratic precision. Used in: (1) Website station pages (full details), (2) Journey planner detail views (complete information), (3) Customer service communications (formal correspondence). Ensures passengers see clear, complete, recognizable station names in all detailed contexts.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>properties.commerciallongnamefrench</td><td>string</td><td>Full commercial name in French, paralleling Dutch commercial long name. Provides comprehensive French passenger-friendly naming for detailed contexts. Used in French-language websites, journey planners, and customer communications. Maintains consistency with official longnamefrench while optimizing for customer clarity.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>properties.geo_point_2d</td><td>object</td><td>Duplicate geographic coordinate in alternative format: object with separate <code>lat</code> (latitude) and <code>lon</code> (longitude) properties. Redundant with <code>geometry.coordinates</code> but provided for convenience in systems preferring named properties over array indexing. Example: <code>{"lat": 50.8466, "lon": 4.3517}</code> for Brussels Central. Used in: (1) Simple distance calculations without parsing GeoJSON geometry, (2) SQL queries (SELECT lat, lon FROM ...), (3) Legacy system integration (expecting separate lat/lon fields). Enables quick coordinate access: <code>feature.properties.geo_point_2d.lat</code> vs. <code>feature.geometry.coordinates[1]</code> (latter requires remembering [lon, lat] order and array indexing). Particularly useful in tabular data contexts (CSV exports, database tables, spreadsheet analysis) where nested geometry objects are awkward.</td></tr>

      <strong>Operational Context:</strong> Operational points form the foundational node layer for understanding Belgium's rail network topology, passenger service coverage, and operational complexity. 
      <em>For passenger information systems</em>, operational points enable station lookup (search by name in either language), journey planning (specifying origin/destination), and service mapping (visualizing station locations on maps with details popup). 
      <em>For network analysts</em>, points combined with line sections create graph structures enabling shortest-path routing, network centrality analysis (identifying critical hub stations), and connectivity studies (measuring network redundancy, analyzing impact of station closures). 
      <em>For planners</em>, operational point data supports service coverage analysis (calculating population within catchment areas), accessibility mapping (identifying underserved regions), and investment prioritization (upgrading high-traffic stations vs. closing low-usage points). 
      <em>For operators</em>, points are essential operational references—train schedules specify ptcarid timing points, dispatchers coordinate train movements between points, maintenance plans target point-specific infrastructure. 
      The rich multilingual nomenclature (short/middle/long names in Dutch and French, commercial variants) reflects Belgium's complex linguistic landscape and legal requirements for bilingual service, enabling appropriate name selection for different audiences and interface constraints. 
      Classification attributes enable filtered queries: passenger-focused analyses ignore technical points (junctions, depots), freight studies focus on terminals and yards, international coordination emphasizes border points. 
      Timestamp-based historical queries reveal network evolution: station openings (network expansion), closures (rationalization), renaming (municipality changes, modernization), and classification changes (upgraded regional stations to intercity hubs). 
      Essential for digital transformation initiatives: real-time passenger information (mapping train positions to station coordinates), predictive arrival systems (calculating distances between current position and next operational point), and integrated multi-modal planning (connecting rail operational points with bus stops, metro stations, bike-share locations).

    <h2>Important Notes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Bilingual Requirements:</strong> Belgium's official bilingualism means virtually all operational points have Dutch and French names. Applications should display appropriate language based on user preference, region, or interface language setting.</li>
      <li><strong>Name Variants:</strong> Multiple name lengths (short/middle/long) and contexts (official vs. commercial) provide flexibility for different interfaces. Choose appropriate variant based on space constraints and audience (passengers vs. operational staff).</li>
      <li><strong>Classification Filtering:</strong> Always filter by classification for passenger-facing applications—junctions, depots, and technical points confuse general users. Use full dataset only for operational/analytical purposes requiring complete network topology.</li>
      <li><strong>Coordinate Precision:</strong> Coordinates suitable for mapping and proximity analysis but not engineering-grade surveying. For precise platform locations or signal placement, consult Infrabel's specialized engineering databases.</li>
