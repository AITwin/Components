  <h1>INFRABEL — Punctuality</h1>
  <pre><code>GET /infrabel/punctuality</code></pre>
  <p class="muted">
    Returns daily reports of train arrival and departure punctuality, comparing scheduled times with actual performance for measuring on-time reliability.
  </p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This endpoint provides comprehensive daily punctuality data for trains operating on Belgium's national rail network, measuring the delta between scheduled and actual arrival/departure times at stations.
      Each record represents a single train stop at a station (identified by operational point name in Dutch), capturing planned vs. actual times for both arrivals and departures, with calculated delay in minutes.
      Data covers passenger and freight trains across the network, enabling performance analysis by: train number (individual trip identification), line number (corridor performance), station (infrastructure bottleneck detection), service type (IC vs. regional vs. freight reliability), and relation/direction (outbound vs. inbound performance asymmetries).
      Essential for operator accountability (measuring adherence to published timetables), infrastructure planning (identifying chronic delay locations requiring investment), service quality monitoring (calculating on-time performance metrics for regulatory reporting), and passenger communication (explaining service reliability patterns).
      Punctuality is the primary quantitative measure of railway service quality, directly impacting passenger satisfaction, operational efficiency, and network capacity utilization.

    <h2>Output Data Attributes</h2>
    <p>The response is a JSON array of punctuality records, each representing one train stop event with scheduled vs. actual timing comparison.</p>
    <table>
      <tr><th>Attribute</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr>
      <tr><td>train_no</td><td>string</td><td>Train number uniquely identifying this specific service. Format varies by operator and train type: IC (intercity) trains use 4-digit numbers (e.g., "1234"), regional trains may use 3-4 digits, international trains often include letter prefixes (e.g., "THA9345" for Thalys), freight trains have operator-specific numbering. Train numbers are stable within a service day (same train_no for entire journey from origin to destination), enabling tracking single train's performance across multiple stations. Used for: (1) Trip-level performance analysis ("which trains are chronically late?"), (2) Operations monitoring (dispatchers tracking specific trains), (3) Passenger information (real-time updates by train number), (4) Reliability scoring (calculating percentage of trains meeting punctuality targets). Train numbers change daily (same physical timetable slot may have different train_no each day), so longitudinal analysis requires combining with other identifiers (line_no_arr, relation).</td></tr>
      <tr><td>datdep</td><td>string</td><td>Operational date of the train service, typically in format <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code> (e.g., "2025-10-23"). Represents the service day when the train journey began—critical for multi-day trains (overnight services departing 23:30 and arriving 06:00 next calendar day both use original departure date). Used for: (1) Temporal filtering ("show all trains on 2025-10-23"), (2) Time-series analysis (tracking punctuality trends over weeks/months), (3) Day-type comparisons (weekday vs. weekend, holiday vs. normal days), (4) Incident correlation (matching delays to known disruptions on specific dates). Essential for aggregating punctuality statistics: daily average delay, monthly on-time performance percentage, yearly reliability trends. Note: datdep is operational date (based on timetable logic), distinct from actual calendar date when train physically arrived (which could be next day for late-running trains).</td></tr>
      <tr><td>ptcar_lg_nm_nl</td><td>string</td><td>Station long name in Dutch—full official operational point name where this train stop occurred. Examples: "Brussel-Zuid" (Brussels South), "Antwerpen-Centraal" (Antwerp Central), "Luik-Guillemins" (Liège-Guillemins). Matches <code>longnamedutch</code> from Operational Points dataset, enabling joins to obtain station coordinates, classifications, and multilingual names. Used for: (1) Station-level punctuality analysis ("which stations have worst average delays?"), (2) Geographic analysis (mapping delay hotspots), (3) Infrastructure bottleneck identification (stations with chronic delays may need capacity expansion, signaling upgrades), (4) Passenger-facing delay explanations ("delays concentrated at Brussels nodes due to congestion"). Dutch is primary language in this dataset (Infrabel internal systems use Dutch as default), but station names are recognizable internationally and can be matched to French equivalents via Operational Points lookup. Essential for joining punctuality data with station metadata (location, type, importance) and visualizing delays on network maps.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>relation</td><td>string</td><td>Train routing or relation description, typically indicating origin-destination pair or service corridor. Format varies: "Brussels - Antwerp", "Liège - Brussels", "Oostende - Eupen" (city pairs), or corridor codes "R12" (relation 12). Defines broad route context beyond individual station stops—same relation may serve 10-20 intermediate stations. Used for: (1) Corridor performance analysis ("Brussels-Antwerp corridor punctuality"), (2) Service pattern grouping (regional services vs. intercity vs. international), (3) Comparative analysis (outbound vs. inbound delays on same relation), (4) Network planning (identifying underperforming corridors requiring investment). May be null for freight trains or trains not fitting standard passenger relations. Complements line_no_arr/line_no_dep (which specify infrastructure line numbers) by providing passenger-oriented route naming.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>relation_direction</td><td>string|null</td><td>Direction or bound of the train service along the relation, if applicable. Values might indicate: "Outbound" (from major hub to periphery), "Inbound" (toward major hub), or directional descriptions "Northbound", "Southbound". Enables analysis of directional asymmetries: morning peak inbound delays (commuter congestion toward Brussels) vs. evening peak outbound delays (reverse commuter flow), or infrastructure-specific issues (uphill grades causing southbound delays). May be null when direction not applicable (freight trains, shuttle services, ambiguous routing). Used for: (1) Peak-period analysis (identifying directional peak congestion), (2) Infrastructure planning (single-track sections causing bidirectional conflicts), (3) Timetable optimization (adjusting schedules based on directional delay patterns).</td></tr>
      <tr><td>train_serv</td><td>string</td><td>Train service type classification. Values indicate service category: <strong>"IC" (InterCity)</strong> = fast long-distance passenger services connecting major cities, <strong>"L" (Local)</strong> = regional stopping trains serving all intermediate stations, <strong>"S" (Suburban)</strong> = urban commuter services with high frequency, <strong>"P" (Peak)</strong> = peak-hour only services, <strong>"INT" (International)</strong> = cross-border services (Eurostar, Thalys, IC to Netherlands/Germany), <strong>"FR" (Freight)</strong> = cargo trains. Service type correlates with punctuality expectations: IC trains have tighter schedules (prioritized routing, fewer stops), regional trains have more recovery time (frequent stops allow catching up), freight trains often deprioritized (yielding to passenger trains causing delays). Used for: (1) Service-specific performance targets (IC trains may target 85% on-time vs. 75% for regional), (2) Priority-based analysis (measuring impact of passenger-first policies on freight punctuality), (3) Capacity allocation (demonstrating infrastructure constraints affect different service types differently). Essential for fair performance comparisons—comparing IC punctuality directly with freight is misleading given different operational constraints.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>line_no_arr</td><td>string|null</td><td>Infrastructure line number for the arrival movement at this station. References Infrabel line section number (matches <code>linecnum</code> from Line Sections dataset). Example: "12" for Brussels-Antwerp main line, "161" for Brussels-Luxembourg line. Indicates which physical rail line the train used to reach this station. May be null for: (a) Origin stations (no arrival, only departure), (b) Data gaps (line assignment missing), (c) Complex stations with ambiguous line attribution. Used for: (1) Line-specific punctuality analysis ("line 12 arrival delays"), (2) Infrastructure bottleneck identification (certain lines chronically delayed), (3) Joining with Line Sections dataset for topology analysis. Distinct from line_no_dep when train changes lines at this station (junction stations where multiple lines converge).</td></tr>
      <tr><td>line_no_dep</td><td>string|null</td><td>Infrastructure line number for the departure movement from this station. References Infrabel line section number. Indicates which physical rail line the train will use when leaving this station. May be null for: (a) Terminal stations (no departure, train terminates), (b) Data gaps. Used for same purposes as line_no_arr but focuses on outbound infrastructure. At junction stations, line_no_arr ≠ line_no_dep (train switches lines), revealing routing changes. Enables analysis of junction performance: "trains switching from line 12 to line 36 at Mechelen experience X-minute average delays" (measuring junction capacity constraints).</td></tr>
      <tr><td>planned_date_arr</td><td>string|null</td><td>Planned (scheduled) arrival date at this station, format <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code>. Typically matches datdep for same-day services. May differ from datdep for: (a) Overnight trains (depart Monday, arrive Tuesday), (b) Long-distance trains (multi-day freight journeys), (c) Extremely delayed trains (scheduled Monday arrival becomes actual Tuesday arrival). Null for origin stations (no arrival). Used for calculating scheduled arrival timestamp (combining planned_date_arr + planned_time_arr), determining expected service day for multi-day trains, and validating date consistency (planned vs. real dates should normally match unless major delays cause day-shifts).</td></tr>
      <tr><td>planned_time_arr</td><td>string|null</td><td>Planned (scheduled) arrival time at this station, format <code>HH:MM:SS</code> (24-hour, e.g., "14:35:00" for 2:35 PM). Represents published timetable arrival time that passengers expect. Null for origin stations. May exceed 24:00:00 for next-day times (e.g., "25:30:00" for 01:30 AM next day), following GTFS convention for late-night services. Used for: (1) Calculating scheduled arrival timestamp (combining with planned_date_arr), (2) Computing arrival delays (real_time_arr - planned_time_arr), (3) Identifying timing point stations (where scheduled times are contractual vs. estimated intermediate times). Core baseline for punctuality measurement—all delay calculations reference planned times.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>real_date_arr</td><td>string|null</td><td>Actual arrival date, format <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code>. Normally matches planned_date_arr. Differs when: (a) Major delays cause day-shift (scheduled Monday arrival becomes Tuesday actual), (b) Multi-day services, (c) Data quality issues (timestamp errors). Null for origin stations or when arrival not recorded (train cancelled before reaching station). Used for: (1) Calculating actual arrival timestamp, (2) Detecting extreme delays (date changes indicate 24+ hour delays or operational disasters), (3) Data validation (real_date ≠ planned_date flags exceptional situations requiring investigation).</td></tr>
      <tr><td>real_time_arr</td><td>string|null</td><td>Actual arrival time recorded by tracking systems, format <code>HH:MM:SS</code>. Represents when train physically arrived at platform (or passed operational point for non-stopping movements). Null when: (a) Origin station (no arrival), (b) Train cancelled before arrival, (c) Data gap (tracking system failure, train not detected). Used for: (1) Calculating arrival delay (delay_arr = real_time_arr - planned_time_arr), (2) Analyzing performance distributions (histogram of arrival times vs. scheduled), (3) Verifying delay calculations (cross-checking reported delay_arr with time difference). Core ground truth for punctuality measurement. Precision typically minute-level (seconds may be rounded or omitted).</td></tr>
      <tr><td>delay_arr</td><td>integer|null</td><td>Arrival delay in minutes, calculated as difference between real_time_arr and planned_time_arr. Positive values = late (train arrived after scheduled time), negative values = early (train arrived before schedule, rare and often undesirable as passengers may miss connections), zero = on-time (exactly as scheduled, rare, usually rounded to nearest minute). Null when: (a) No arrival (origin stations, cancelled trains), (b) Missing timing data (real or planned time unavailable). Industry standard defines on-time threshold: typically ±5 minutes for punctuality statistics (delay_arr between -5 and +5 considered "on time"). Used for: (1) On-time performance calculation (percentage of delays within threshold), (2) Average delay metrics (mean, median), (3) Delay distributions (histograms showing delay patterns), (4) Extreme delay detection (outliers indicating major incidents). Core KPI for service quality: operators may have contractual targets (e.g., "85% of trains within 5 minutes of schedule"). Negative delays rare (operators avoid early arrivals disrupting timetable synchronization).</td></tr>
      <tr><td>planned_date_dep</td><td>string|null</td><td>Planned departure date from this station, format <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code>. Typically matches planned_date_arr (same day arrival and departure). May differ when: (a) Long dwell times at major stations (arrive late evening, depart early morning), (b) Overnight services (terminal layover), (c) Extreme delays (arrive one day, depart next). Null for terminal stations (train terminates, no departure). Used for calculating scheduled departure timestamp, validating date consistency, and analyzing dwell time patterns (planned_time_dep - planned_time_arr = scheduled station dwell).</td></tr>
      <tr><td>planned_time_dep</td><td>string|null</td><td>Planned departure time from this station, format <code>HH:MM:SS</code>. Published timetable time when train should leave. Null for terminal stations. Typically > planned_time_arr (trains dwell at stations for passenger boarding/alighting, connections, schedule recovery). Difference (planned_time_dep - planned_time_arr) reveals scheduled dwell: 1-2 minutes for minor stops, 5-10 minutes for major interchange stations, 15-60 minutes for terminals. Used for: (1) Calculating departure delay, (2) Analyzing dwell time patterns (scheduled vs. actual dwell affecting downstream punctuality), (3) Identifying timing points (stations with significant scheduled dwell for schedule recovery). Operators may build "slack time" into schedules (extra dwell allowing delay absorption—train arrives late but departures on time, preventing delay propagation).</td></tr>
      <tr><td>real_date_dep</td><td>string|null</td><td>Actual departure date from this station, format <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code>. Typically matches planned_date_dep. Differs when delays cause day-shift or for overnight services. Null for terminal stations or cancelled trains. Used for calculating actual departure timestamp, detecting extreme delays (date changes), and validating data consistency.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>real_time_dep</td><td>string|null</td><td>Actual departure time recorded by tracking systems, format <code>HH:MM:SS</code>. When train physically left station (doors closed, movement initiated). Null for terminal stations or cancelled trains. Used for: (1) Calculating departure delay (delay_dep = real_time_dep - planned_time_dep), (2) Analyzing dwell time deviations (real dwell vs. planned dwell), (3) Identifying delay propagation (arrival delays absorbed or amplified during station dwell). Precision minute-level. Operators monitor departure punctuality separately from arrival punctuality—train may arrive late but depart on time (catching up during dwell) or arrive on-time but depart late (dwell problems create new delays).</td></tr>
      <tr><td>delay_dep</td><td>integer|null</td><td>Departure delay in minutes, calculated as real_time_dep - planned_time_dep. Positive = late departure, negative = early (undesirable), zero = on-time (rare). Null for terminal stations or missing data. Used for: (1) Departure punctuality statistics (separate KPI from arrival punctuality), (2) Dwell time analysis (comparing arrival vs. departure delays reveals time gained/lost during station stop), (3) Delay propagation studies (how arrival delays affect downstream services—do delays recover or worsen?). Important distinction: arrival delay measures infrastructure/timetable adequacy (enough time between stations?), departure delay measures operational efficiency (dwell time managed effectively? connections coordinated?). Operators prioritize departure punctuality at major stations (ensuring downstream connections aren't missed) even if arrival was delayed, achieved by reducing dwell time (speeding passenger exchange, skipping non-essential activities). Difference (delay_dep - delay_arr) reveals dwell impact: positive difference = delay increased during dwell (operational problems), negative difference = delay absorbed (recovery time utilized).</td></tr>

      <strong>Operational Context:</strong> Punctuality data is the quantitative heartbeat of railway service quality, measuring operator performance against published commitments and revealing infrastructure constraints. 
      <em>For passengers</em>, punctuality statistics inform travel planning decisions (choosing reliable routes, allowing connection buffers), set service expectations, and provide accountability (demanding explanations for chronic delays). 
      <em>For operators (SNCB/NMBS)</em>, punctuality is the primary performance KPI: (1) Regulatory targets (government contracts specify minimum on-time percentages), (2) Compensation triggers (EU regulations require refunds for significant delays), (3) Operational diagnosis (identifying problematic trains, times, corridors requiring schedule adjustment), (4) Resource allocation (prioritizing investments in delay-reducing improvements). 
      <em>For Infrabel (infrastructure manager)</em>, punctuality reveals infrastructure bottlenecks: stations with chronic delays need capacity expansion (additional tracks, improved signaling), line sections with frequent delays require speed improvements or double-tracking, junctions with switching delays need layout optimization. 
      <em>For regulators</em>, punctuality data supports performance monitoring (ensuring public funding delivers acceptable service levels), competitive tendering (comparing operators bidding for service contracts), and policy development (setting realistic targets balancing service quality with cost). 
      <em>For researchers</em>, the data enables: (1) Service reliability modeling (predicting punctuality from schedules, infrastructure, traffic patterns), (2) Timetable optimization (identifying schedule adjustments reducing delays), (3) Network resilience analysis (measuring delay propagation—how one delay cascades across network), (4) Economic impact studies (quantifying passenger time costs of unreliability). 
      The rich attribution—by train, station, line, service type, direction—enables multi-dimensional analysis: peak vs. off-peak reliability, weekday vs. weekend patterns, seasonal effects (weather, autumn leaves, summer heat), corridor comparisons, and service type differences. 
      Daily granularity supports time-series analysis: trending (is punctuality improving or degrading?), anomaly detection (identifying exceptional disruption days), seasonal adjustment (normalizing for winter weather effects), and before/after studies (measuring infrastructure upgrade impacts). 
      Critical for Belgium's rail-dependent economy: punctuality affects commuter productivity (late arrivals reduce work hours), freight competitiveness (unreliable schedules drive cargo to roads), and international connectivity (delays affecting Eurostar, Thalys damage Belgium's European hub role).

    <h2>Important Notes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>On-Time Definition:</strong> Industry-standard punctuality threshold is typically ±5 minutes. Always specify threshold when reporting "on-time percentage" to ensure comparability across studies and operators.</li>
      <li><strong>Origin/Terminal Nulls:</strong> origin stations have null arrival fields (delay_arr, planned/real time_arr), terminal stations have null departure fields. Filter appropriately: arrival analysis excludes origins, departure analysis excludes terminals.</li>
      <li><strong>Extreme Delays:</strong> Very large delay values (hundreds of minutes) may indicate: (1) Genuine major disruptions (accidents, severe weather), (2) Data errors (timestamp mismatches, cancelled trains incorrectly coded), (3) Freight trains left in sidings (not actively delayed, just deprioritized). Validate extreme outliers before including in averages.</li>
      <li><strong>Dutch Language:</strong> Station names in Dutch (ptcar_lg_nm_nl) only. For bilingual applications, join with Operational Points dataset to obtain French equivalents (longnamefrench). Language consistency simplifies joins—use ptcar_lg_nm_nl as matching key with longnamedutch from Operational Points.</li>
